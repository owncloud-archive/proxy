# ownCloud Connect

ownCloud Connect makes it easier to make your ownCloud accessible from the Internet
even if it is installed behind a firewall or router. This is done by making the
setup of a reverse proxy system very easy.

The technical implementation is happening using either Pagekite or the ownCloud
Connect service.
